# SiebelBookmarklets

Bookmarklets is short scripts performed in the context of the current page. With the introduction of Siebel Open UI, it became possible to communicate with Siebel directly from the current browser window.

Each of Bookmarklets can be placed on favorite panel as bookmark and receive the Siebel functionality from the browser menu.

The idea of using bookmarklets is taken from the site http://xapuk.com/.
